# COVID_analysis
The main objective of this project is to explore whether individuals residing in disadvantaged socioeconomic and housing environments are more susceptible to COVID-19 transmission.
The project was carried out with my colleague Andres Gibson as the Final Project for a course on Geographic Analysis Tools in the Master's in Public Administration program at Universidad Torcuato Di Tella.
